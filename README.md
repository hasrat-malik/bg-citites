# üåÜ bg-cities

**bg-cities** is a Node.js application that fetches a list of cities from an external [pollution data API](https://be-recruitment-task.onrender.com/pollution), validates each city using the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/), and enriches the results with descriptions from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). The final output is a filtered and enriched list of valid cities with pollution data and contextual information.
